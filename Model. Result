# The most popular tools we used to implement CNNs, offering a high level of abstraction and GPU support:

TensorFlow (with Keras)

Overview: TensorFlow is an open-source deep learning framework developed by Google. Keras, a high-level API, is integrated with TensorFlow, making it easy to build and train CNN models.

Usage: TensorFlow is widely used for CNNs due to its flexibility and support for both research and production.

Features:

Pre-built layers for CNNs (Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, etc.).

Model training, evaluation, and prediction functions.

GPU acceleration for faster computation.
